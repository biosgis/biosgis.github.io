TITLE

Bay Delta 
Spring Kodiak Trawl Survey 
Delta Smelt Distribution Pie Chart Maps 
Legacy Map App Migration

------------------
PURPOSE


------------------
METHODOLOGY

Basic Disks

SVG

Rings

Semi-Transparent Circles


------------------
RESULTS

What we need is not only multivariate rendering but multivariate symbology, 
where a feature can be symbolized by multiple fields at the same time and 
in a related way like as percentages to a summary column (built-in or dynamic)



-------------------
CONCLUSION

Migrating our legacy application show the limitation of the latest mapping 
API even compared to old technology. 
Scientists have a very keen eye in developing visualizations 
and geographic information technologist should pay attentions to that
