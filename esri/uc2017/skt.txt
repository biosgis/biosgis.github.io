PURPOSE


------------------
METHODOLOGY

Basic Disks

SVG

Rings

Semi-Transparent Circles

The multivariate symbology method like the sample 
https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/visualization-multivariate-2d/live/index.html 
works pretty well when you have 3 or fewer classes to color. 
However, the average user cannot really visually distinguish more than a couple 
of categories when more than 2 shades are superimposed on top of each other.
So when we apply 6 different colors to the dataset for point features that 
overlap over the same locations, it shows nice concentric circles but does not 
provide clarity in terms the different categories mapped over the same point.


------------------
RESULTS

What we need is not only multivariate rendering but multivariate symbology, 
where a feature can be symbolized by multiple fields at the same time and 
in a related way like as percentages to a summary column (built-in or dynamic)



-------------------
CONCLUSION

Migrating our legacy application show the limitation of the latest mapping 
API even compared to old technology. 
Scientists have a very keen eye in developing visualizations 
and geographic information technologist should pay attentions to that
